## Q3 - SCENARIO

A Toy Retail company ToyTrex has it retail application deployed as 3-tier application - Web App(UI), Web
API(middle layer) and Database as Azure SQL. The user load started increasing multiple fold every month and complex programs getting implemented,
the application started performing poorly. As a result, company decided to re-architect the middle layer as microservices using Azure Kubernetes
Services. The new architecture has below design decisions.
- The middle layer should be implemented as Microservices using Azure AKS
- The middle layer API should be deployed as containerized application images
- The container images will use Azure Container Repository (ACR) as the private image repository
- The CI/CD pipelines for microservices should be implemented using Azure DevOps services.
- The Azure DevOps should be able to access ACR and download the container images for microservices
deployment
- The image should be deployed as templates such as &lt;image_name&gt;:&lt;build_id&gt;

Explain the DevOps configuration and steps in detail for above requirements

The process remains the same. Just adding the deployment steps for AKS deployment using Azure DevOps

**CI part**
- Go to Respective Project
- Click on Pipeline
- Click on Create pipeline using YAML or Classic editor, choose Docker template
    - Build an image:
    	 - Docker registry: Where we want to push ACR/DockerHub
    	 - Action: Build an image
    	 - Select Dockerfile location
    	 - Image Name: $(Build.Repository.Name):$(Build.BuildId)
     - Push an image
    	- Docker Reg service connection : ACR
    	- Action: Push an Image
    	- Image Name: Mention same as we provided in Build Image step
     - Add Copy file task
    	- Select yml file
    	- Contents: file name
    	- Target folder: 
     - Publish  Build artifacts:drop(directory name)
 
 **CD**:
 - New release pipeline
 - Slect Deploy to kuberentes cluster
 - Pipeline name
	- Select artifact source
	- Select Project
	- Slect pipeline
	- Apply
- Go inside task
	- Kubectl apply
